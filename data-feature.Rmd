```{r}
filepath <- "data/"
raw_data <- read.csv(paste0(filepath,"geothermal.csv"))

```


```{r}
head(raw_data)
top_countries <- names(sort(table(raw_data['affiliation.country']),decreasing = TRUE)[1:20])
rank = sort(table(raw_data['affiliation.country']),decreasing = TRUE)[1:15]
plot(rank)
pie(rank, main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```


```{r}
select_data <- raw_data[raw_data$affiliation.country %in% top_countries,]
# new zealand avg rank
x = select_data$affiliation.country == 'New Zealand'
mean(which(x == TRUE))
hist(which(x == TRUE),main = "New Zealand rank distribution",xlab = 'Rank index')
# USA avg rank
x = select_data$affiliation.country == 'United States'
mean(which(x == TRUE))
hist(which(x == TRUE),main = "USA rank  distribution",xlab = 'Rank index')
# CHINA avg rank
x = select_data$affiliation.country == 'China'
mean(which(x == TRUE))
hist(which(x == TRUE),main = "CHINA rank  distribution",xlab = 'Rank index')
```


Do T test among countires

```{r}
# NZ Rank
X <- select_data$affiliation.country == 'New Zealand'
NZ_rank <- which(X == TRUE)
X <- select_data$affiliation.country == 'United States'
USA_rank <- which(X == TRUE)
X <- select_data$affiliation.country == 'China'
CH_rank <- which(X == TRUE)

```


```{r}
t.test(NZ_rank,USA_rank)
t.test(NZ_rank,CH_rank)
```

The T test result of NZ and USA. The p-value is 0.022. Smaller than 0.05. So it means that there is a difference between NZ and USA.

On the other hand. There is no difference between NZ and China.
