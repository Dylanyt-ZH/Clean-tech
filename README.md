# Clean-tech

Shiyu Tong master degree project



The Cleantech project aims to find areas where New Zealand is ahead of other countries in the Cleantech area. The data used for the project were research papers from different countries,  downloaded from the Elsevier database. The project completed a statistical analysis of each country to determine the research efficiency of each country, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm as the main method to model the themes and analyse where each country is going in the cleantech field. The analysis shows that New Zealand has more research and is ahead of other countries in Additive Manufacturing, Geothermal, Green Building, Smart Home, Waste Reduction and Zero Waste. The project also summarises the research directions between the different countries to identify potential collaboration opportunities.
